# HOLLOW POINT

A Hollow Knight mod that gives the Knight the ability to wield a modern day assault rifle.
Why did I make this? I wish I knew too.

While this mod is not to be taken seriously, It still attempts to keep a semblance of balance while being fun to play without it ending up as a 5 minute gimmick, at least thats what I hope im doing.


### FEATURES:
-	The knight now has a rifle capable of firing at all 8 cardinal directions.
-	Firing your weapon while wall sliding.
-	New save or loaded save compatibility, as well as uninstallation capability (better back up your saves regardless though).
-	Firing costs SOUL, but hitting regains more than the cost, so don’t miss your shots.
-	Any damage you deal with your bullets will reset your dash/double jump, allowing you to stay on air as long as you keep hitting enemies.
- Firing below propels you! Use this to keep afloat above enemies while you pepper them, stay mobile during a fight or access areas you normally cant.
-	Heat and recoil mechanics, the longer you fire the more innacurate youll be, forcing you to fire at burst against farther targets.
-	Several (about 70%+) charms that was modified to fit the gun mechanics (These charms are still subject to change including the ones that don’t have any changes yet, until I get a good idea of how they should be changed. **Not all charms will be changed for the sake of changing them, but I do want to modify all of it to fit inline thematically, or at least to balance them out with the rest**).
-	Replaces/modifies base spells to fit them both more inline mechanically and thematically.
-	Modifies nail damage and soul gain to fit better without being inherently useless. **Upgrading your nail upgrades both your weapon range and damage**.
- Terrible obviously made excuse plot made to explain both the shard and the gun that was inspired from S.T.A.L.K.E.R.

### What it does NOT do:
-	Contain changes to nail arts for now but I do have plans to not leave them behind the ditch.
- Touch dialogues of NPCs outside of charms and skills. (Might change some of them though just to keep it inline with the gun)
- Add new bosses, sprites, music or modifies any of them.
- Change charm cost values.
- Care about lore.

### CONTROLS:
**Tapping the focus button no longer cast spells, instead they swap between the nail or the gun. Quick cast is now the required button needed to cast “spells”, but the Focus mechanic still works the same.**

- FIREBALL (Vengeful Spirit/Shade Soul) = ROCKET LAUNCH
REQUIRES **GUN** TO BE ACTIVE - 
Launch a rocket, requires 33 soul. Can be fired in all direction 
Explosion scales off nail damage.

- DIVE (Desolate Dive/Descending Dark) = TYPHOON SCATTER
REQUIRES **NAIL** TO BE ACTIVE -
Dive is still the same, requires 33 soul. Will now scatter weak bombs around you if you press ATTACK the moment you hit the ground, for an additional 33 soul. Designed to eliminate weaker enemies that surrounds you. Totally did not ripoff the Typhoon skill from Deus Ex, totally.

- SCREAM (Howling Wraith/Abyss Shriek) = ACTIVATE SHARD
REQUIRES **NAIL** TO BE ACTIVE -
After activating artifact/scream ability (Tap + Up), notice that you will glow indicating that the ability is now active, Tap + Up again to disable this, casting any of the following ability requires 1 Shard power, which is refilled by sitting on the bench. (Later to also refill by doing enough damage)


**While Shard is activated, Tap ATTACK while wielding the NAIL for INFUSION**

INFUSION buffs you for a couple of seconds. The buff passively gives you soul for its duration (8 seconds), though its duration and effects can change depending on certain charms (make you dash more often, run faster, etc). Designed to accomodate builds that heavily uses soul.

**While Shard is activated, Tap ATTACK while wielding the GUN for BOMBARDMENT**

Fire a flare at a target, immediately launch several missiles that will track an enemy it hits, or at a surface. Your own explosive can and will damage you.

### Q&A:
##### Q: Why, just why?

A: The massive amount of fan art involving Hollow Knight characters with guns was asking for it and I just had to. Also being able to create a massive high effort shitpost is something I'm proud of.

##### Q: What the hell is the shard supposed to be?
 
A: Inspired from S.T.A.L.K.E.R. where weird radioactive artifacts give special properties and bonuses to whoever carries them (with the sole problem that they emit radiation). In the case for this mod, its used as an excuse to call cast/manifest/conjure/etc soul regen buffs or artillery strikes.

##### Q: Is this compatible with mod X or Y?

A: So far QOL, RANDOMIZER, HP Bars works without any weird oddities, but while it may TECHNICALLY work with other large overhaul mods such as Blackmoth/Redwing or Lightbringer, they change stuff that’ll conflict with my other changes too, so best to just use these major mods by themselves. Baseline would be that anything that alters the way charm behaves is out of the question. (Yes, this involves mods like Charm Overhaul or Exaltation, please)

##### Q: Is this safe to Install/Uninstall on an existing save?

A: Should be, this mod loads all of its stuff on the fly when you load/make a new save and it doesn’t do anything that would permanently affect the game. THAT SAID, you should ALWAYS backup your save when using mods. This applies to any mod really, better safe than sorry.

##### Q: I think __________ can be improved/ and here’s my suggestion.

A:  I’m neither the most creative person nor do I have infinite free time so the charm ideas can be lame I know but if you do have inquires, just message me and I’ll see what I can do (depending on what the request is at least). 

##### Q: I think this charm is lackluster/I have suggestions on how it can be balanced/improved further. 

A: Please message me! I take suggestions with consideration. Just do note some charms I haven’t change as I dislike the idea of changing stuff for the sake of changing stuff.

##### Q: I found bugs (original joke haha).

A: If you find any, please message me of WHAT it is and HOW you got it, and I’ll try my best to address it.

##### Q: IS THE TITLE A GUNGEON REFERENCE??!!?111!?!?!.

A: No, a Hollow Point is an actual low penetration type bullet mostly used by law enforcement and I got from other games that incorporate that bullet type. But yes, I am aware of the Gungeon enemy and I have played Gungeon before. 

##### Q: Worst Boss?

A: Definitely Gatling Gull.
