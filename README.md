# Hollow-Point

A Hollow Knight mod that gives you a gun with varying generic ammo types

Planned stuff
- Make the knight actually have gun at their sprite
- Bullet deviation to simulate recoil and promote the use of more ammo types
- Add actual gunshot sounds
- Do something about the spells and the nail arts
- (Maybe) be able to buy ammunition from Sly's store
- Bapanada

"Radiance made moths and Radiance made bugs, but Sam Colt made them equal" - Monomon probably
